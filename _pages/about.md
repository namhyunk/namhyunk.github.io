        I’m a PhD student at Arizona State University working on next-generation wireless networks and how AI can rethink their design and optimization. I’m advised by
        <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dLHw2qcAAAAJ&hl=en">Prof. Ahmed Alkhateeb</a>.
        Before ASU, I worked as a network engineer at <a href="https://www.sktelecom.com/index_en.html">SK Telecom</a>, collaborating closely with
        <a href="https://yonsei-jpark.github.io/">Prof. Jeonghun Park</a> and <a href="https://www.icl.kaist.ac.kr/people/professor">Prof. Junil Choi</a>.

My research interests include AI-native wireless systems, foundation models/representation learning for wireless signals, and practical signal processing and protocol design for massive MIMO and integrated sensing and communications (ISAC), with an emphasis on reducing overhead such as CSI feedback.

I am a recipient of the **Korean Government Scholarship Program (KGSP)** ([NIIED](http://www.niied.go.kr/eng/main.do)).
