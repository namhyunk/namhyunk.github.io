Hi there! I'm Namhyun Kim, and I'm currently pursuing my PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering at [Arizona State University](https://www.asu.edu/). 

I work on next-generation wireless networks and how AI can rethink their design and optimization. That path led me from South Korea to Arizona, where I keep exploring what's possible with these systems. I'm advised by [Prof. Ahmed Alkhateeb](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dLHw2qcAAAAJ&hl=en), and before ASU I worked as a network engineer at [SK Telecom](https://www.sktelecom.com/index_en.html), collaborating closely with [Prof. Jeonghun Park](https://yonsei-jpark.github.io/) and [Prof. Junil Choi](https://www.icl.kaist.ac.kr/people/professor).

## Research

I’m interested in building wireless systems that are *practical*, *data-driven*, and *deployable*—from PHY-layer signal processing to AI-native network intelligence.

- **AI-native wireless**: learning-based representations and foundation models for wireless signals
- **FDD massive MIMO**: reducing overhead (especially CSI feedback) while keeping performance high
- **Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC)**: joint design for communication + sensing under realistic constraints

For more details, see my [Research Interests](/research/) page.
