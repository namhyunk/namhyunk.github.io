I am a PhD student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at [Arizona State University](https://www.asu.edu/). I work on next-generation wireless networks and how AI can rethink their design and optimization. I’m advised by [Prof. Ahmed Alkhateeb](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dLHw2qcAAAAJ&hl=en). I am a recipient of the **Korean Government Scholarship Program (KGSP)** ([NIIED](http://www.niied.go.kr/eng/main.do)).

My research focuses on building wireless systems that are practical, data-driven, and deployable—from PHY-layer signal processing to AI-native network intelligence. I’m particularly interested in representation learning and foundation models for wireless signals, and in system/protocol design for massive MIMO and integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) under realistic overhead constraints (e.g., CSI feedback).

Current projects include:

- AI-native wireless systems and foundation models for wireless signals
- Massive MIMO design with reduced overhead (especially CSI feedback)
- Integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) for practical FDD systems

Prior to joining ASU, I worked as a network engineer at [SK Telecom](https://www.sktelecom.com/index_en.html), collaborating closely with [Prof. Jeonghun Park](https://yonsei-jpark.github.io/) and [Prof. Junil Choi](https://www.icl.kaist.ac.kr/people/professor). I received my **M.S. in Electrical Engineering** (2023) from [KAIST](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/) and my **B.S. in Electrical and Electronic Engineering** (Hons., 2021) from [Yonsei University](https://www.yonsei.ac.kr/en_sc/index.do).
