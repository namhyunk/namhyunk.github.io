## Abstract

We explore integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) in frequency-division duplex (FDD) MIMO systems without requiring channel state information (CSI) feedback. This work was presented at the 22nd International Symposium on Modeling and Optimization in Mobile, Ad Hoc, and Wireless Networks (WiOpt) in Seoul, South Korea.

## Key Contributions

- **ISAC Framework**: Novel framework for FDD MIMO ISAC
- **No CSI Feedback**: Eliminates the need for CSI feedback in FDD systems
- **Performance Analysis**: Comprehensive analysis of sensing and communication trade-offs
