## Abstract

We present a comprehensive framework for integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) in downlink frequency-division duplex (FDD) MIMO systems that operates without requiring channel state information (CSI) feedback. This work combines rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) techniques with sophisticated error covariance estimation methods to address the complex non-linear eigenvalue problems inherent in joint sensing and communication optimization.
