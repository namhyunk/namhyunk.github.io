## Abstract

We present a framework for integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) in frequency-division duplex (FDD) MIMO systems that operates without requiring channel state information (CSI) feedback. This work was presented at the 2025 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT) in Ann Arbor, MI, USA.

## Key Contributions

- **CSI-Free ISAC**: Novel approach to integrated sensing and communications without CSI feedback
- **FDD MIMO Framework**: Practical implementation for FDD MIMO systems
- **Theoretical Analysis**: Information-theoretic analysis of the proposed approach
